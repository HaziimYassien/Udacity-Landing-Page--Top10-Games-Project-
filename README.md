started the project by designing the top 10 games logo which was I made on picsart with basic icons

then started choosing and writing the top 10 games

then started writing the html setup with fully named classes and ids

then selected the classes and IDs in the css file and the js file

then started adding basic colors for the sections and buttons in the css file

started adding the basic code in javascript first I used IDs and classes only then I started making the code more comptiable so that it can fit adding extra sections then I added the scroll to top button
