            <h3 class="GameName">#1 : Dark souls 1</h3>
            <img src="images/DarkSoulsImage.jpg" alt="dark souls image" srcset="">
            <p>considered as one of the best games created it's considered a classic and ranked as one of the top 10
                games , the player doesn't receive a tutorial at the beginning of the game the player is just emmersed
                in a prison cell where he doesn't even know how to open the gate of his prison cell, most people know
                the game from memes and gifs related to it, the player walks in a long hall and on his right he sees a
                huge monster whose footsteps are shaking the hall prison so the player can understand how weak he is in
                this world, by the end of the game when the player comes back to these small monsters he can feel how
                much progress he made</p>

            <h3 class="GameName">#2: Fallout 3</h3>
            <img src="images/FalloutImage.png" alt="" srcset="">
            <p>before fallout 3 the fallout series was for pure nerds it was an rpg which took alot of time for the
                player to understand what's so fun about this game the interface looked boring so gamers passed it , in
                fallout 3 they developed the game to be a 3d fps and tps shooter game it's considerd on of the best
                games ever made, once the player leaves vault 101 the game really starts to get into him the movement is
                realstic and at first there's no teleportaiton just the player and the dessert and the map design is
                full of locations that you can't walk for two minutes without viewing a strange building that calls you
                to explore him . the radio in the game is one of the best things abotu this game the fact that you can't
                change the song only change the channel and some of the channels can't be heard clearly because it's far
                away the songs played are classic first you wonder why are they playing classic music shouldn't there be
                a cyberpunk kind of music playing right now and then you really don't care it fits the gameplay, the
                aiming assist system in the game is beyond description the player will remebre the feeling of aiming
                three times at a bandit head and watch the character shoot while listening to a classic song playing on
                the radio</p>

            <h3 class="GameName">#3: dead space</h3>
            <img src="images/DeadSpaceImage.jpg" alt="">
            <p>dead space 1 is considered to be a life experience it's not a normal game the player experience a new
                level of strange fear that you have never witnessed before unlike other in the middle of the game you
                realize that you are prepared for whatever comes at you whatever type of monster or enemy you might see
                you have the weapon for it you've been upgrading three weapons and have been upgrading your suit and
                have had enough training to know how to demolish any nine limbs monster you might come across then a
                monster's arm comes out of the wall and drag you like a puppet while the player is swinging in the air
                like an old shirt used as a towel in a chinese kitchen he relises that he doens't even know where to
                shoot this thing and you get the idea that the game is trying to make you understand you are nothing the
                space is very big from far away your planet is a small white dot</p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="GameName">#4: celeste</h3>
            <img src="images/CelesteImage.jpg" alt="">
            <p>a 2d platformer that fights mental issues, this game is highly recommended for anyone who doesn't feel
                okay the first level of the game you fight that inner voice that keeps telling you you are not enough
                that everyone is better than you a figure similar to you starts chasing you for many levels the more you
                run from it the more they become until in the last level you feel anxiety that's coming from that person
                and you understand that you are trying to prove to him and to yourself how good you acctually are in
                that activity or hobby that you are doing for fun then the player keeps failing because he is focused on
                the figure that's chasing him once you ignore that figure's existance and feel that anxiety slowly
                coming off your shoulder you start focusing on the road ahead of you and realize how easy it is to pass
                that level once you ignore that inner voice that keeps telling you that you are not good enough </p>

            <h3 class="GameName">#5: hotline Miami</h3>
            <img src="images/HotLineMiamiImage.jpg" alt="">
            <p>the game is nostalgic in it's feeling everyone has this feeling even if he doesn't know it or confirm it
                and this game pressed that INNER button it clicks that switch ,the music gets in you and fills the
                player with feelings, the game is considered as one of the most brutal games ever made that some people
                ignore it for it's brutality but I think that everyone should give it a try,the game is extremly hard
                and very reptetative but the player doesn't get enough you wanna play that same level again for some
                reason</p>

            <img src="images/bioshockImage.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            <img src="images/sekiroImage.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
                undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
                Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
                theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor
                sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
